# Multitask
Multitask is a library for simple single-threaded cooperative multitasking in C.
## Notes
This library is very incomplete, so there are many unimplemented features and bugs that can result in undefined behavior.


Only tested using gcc.
## Usage
### Using in a project
Include the library in the project. For now use the -masm-intel and -O0 option while compiling.
