# Multitask
Simple cooperative multitasking library in C.
## Notes
This library is very incomplete, so there are many unimplemented features and bugs that can result in undefined behavior.
## Usage
Include the library in the project and `#define MULTITASK_IMPLEMENTATION` in one file where the library is included before the `#include` directive.

For compilation I have only used gcc with -masm-intel and -O0 options.
