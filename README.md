# Multitask
Simple cooperative multitasking library in C.
## Notes
This library is very incomplete, so there are many unimplemented features and bugs that can result in undefined behavior.
## Usage
### Including the library
Add `#include "multitask.h"` in a project.

### Compilation
For compilation I have only used gcc with -masm-intel and -O0 options.
